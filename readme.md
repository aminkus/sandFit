# SandFit Fitness

This application offers the user a platform where they can keep track of thier diet as well as generate exercises with diagrams to help the user build a complete fitness program. The user will make an account, and upon registration will enter in some personal information that a third party API will use to determine how many calories that individual should intake each day. The user will also be able to log the food they consume and it will update the calorie function and display how many more calories they have remaining in the day.
